1) complete the TODOS:  see code.  examples are the table overrides for data type names, code subsitution tags,
   etc...
2) Custom logging interface via listener
3) Dont initialize singleton classes until command line has been processed
4) Build off of stored procs and views as well as tables
5) templates can identify what snippets to use rather than assumed snippets
6) interface for sql parameter formatting as some DB implementations do not support named
   parameters
7) current snippet use is hardcoded aka name=CRUDInsert has to be used for insert functions
   not sure if this is a good idea and might want to look at redesigning this a bit
8) Add "packages support" with a package being a complete configuration (aka moving whats in 
   the app.config file is right now into a "package").  A package could be defined in a separate 
   file or as a section in the app.config.
9) Create a GUI app (probably requires "package support" and some of the other ideas above)   
10)Support for tables that have more than one column as key, and no primary key
11)Support for generating other .NET CLR compatiable languages.
