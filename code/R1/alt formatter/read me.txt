This folder contains an example of using the IDataMemberNameFormatter interface to build your own data member formatter.

The purpose of a data member formatter is to format the "structure" of a data member in a class.  Different
entities have different style guides.  Since it's impossible to predict all of the possible ways the styles might
be applied, the IDataMemberNameFormatter interface gives users the ability to use their own.

It's really very straight forward to use.   Derive a class from 
MattRaffelNetCode.Apps.SqlCodeGen.InterfacesIDataMemberNameFormatter as defined in the SqlCodeGenSupport.dll 
assembly.  By implementing MakeDataMemberName you have a formatter ready.

You will need to update SQLCODEGEN.CONFIG file to know to use your formatter.  In this folder is an example
of an updated SQLCODEGEN.CONFIG file to use the sample formatter provided.  You also need to copy your assembly,
containing your class derived from InterfacesIDataMemberNameFormatter into the folder containing the program.

If you wish to use the sample provided, simply copy AlternateMemberFormatter.dll into the SQLCODEGEN.EXE folder, update 
the config file (or copy the existing one).  I think that works ;)
